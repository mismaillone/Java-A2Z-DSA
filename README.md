## Algorithms

Explore classic algorithms, spanning sorting, searching, graph traversal, and dynamic programming.

## Data Structures

Discover essential data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.

## Supported Languages

The implementations cover a wide range of programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, Swift, C#, Kotlin, Rust, PHP, TypeScript, and more. Feel free to contribute your implementations in languages not mentioned here, as inclusivity is a core principle of this repository!

## How to Utilize

Each algorithm and data structure resides within a dedicated folder following a consistent naming convention. Inside each folder, you'll encounter the implementation accompanied by a concise explanation of its functionality and a breakdown of time complexity.

To integrate the code into your projects, simply navigate to the relevant folder and select your preferred programming language. Copy the code into your work and adapt it to suit your needs.

## Contributions Welcome

Contributions are eagerly welcomed! Should you wish to contribute:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch named after your feature/fix.
3. Craft your implementation within the designated language folder.
4. Provide a clear explanation of the algorithm/data structure.
5. Open a pull request.

Please respect the repository's code of conduct and deliver well-documented, high-quality code.

## Licensing

This repository operates under the open-source MIT License, permitting you to utilize the code for projects and educational purposes without restraint.
