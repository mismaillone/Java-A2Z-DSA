# A2Z DSA Repository

Welcome to the A2Z DSA (Algorithms and Data Structures) repository! This repository is a collection of various algorithms and data structures implemented in different programming languages. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about fundamental concepts or an experienced developer brushing up on your skills, this repository has something for everyone.

## Contents

- **Algorithms**: Implementations of classic algorithms, ranging from sorting and searching to graph traversal and dynamic programming.

- **Data Structures**: Examples of essential data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.

## Languages

The implementations are provided in Java programming languages,  but not limited to:

- Java
- C++

Feel free to contribute your own implementations in other languages as well!

## How to Use

Each algorithm and data structure has its own dedicated folder with a clear naming convention. Inside each folder, you'll find the implementation along with a brief explanation of the algorithm's working and time complexity analysis.

To use the code, simply navigate to the relevant folder and choose your preferred programming language. Copy and integrate the code into your own projects, and adapt it as needed.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix.
3. Implement your algorithm/data structure in the chosen language's folder.
4. Add a clear explanation of how the algorithm/data structure works.
5. Create a pull request.

Please follow the repository's code of conduct and contribute high-quality, well-documented code.

## License
